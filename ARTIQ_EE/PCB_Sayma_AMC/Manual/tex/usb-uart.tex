\section{USB-UART}
\subsection{USB console switch}

UART from FPGA is connected through Multiplexer (SN74CB3T3257PW). Selection between MMC and USB is preformed automaticly. When micro-USB is connected, +5V from USB bus  switches the multiplexer to pass data from USB to FPGA, after un plugging cable, the switch signal S fall down and the multiplexer conects MMC to FPGA.\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item PRI\_UART is connected to FPGA, configuration is 1N8 115200 baudrate
	\item AUX\_UART is connected to FPGA, configuration is 1N8 115200 baudrate
	\item UART1 is connected to MMC, configuration is 1N8 115200 baudrate
	\item UART4 is connected to MMC, configuration is 1N8 115200 baudrate
	\item MMC\_CONS\_PROG is conected to MMC, configuration is 1N8 115200 baudrate
\end{itemize}

\subsection{USB-UART bridge}

The USB-UART bridge (FT4232H) requires USB device drivers, vailable free from http://www.ftdichip.com,
which are used to make the FT4232H on the Mini Module appear as a four virtual COM ports (VCP). This
then allows the user to communicate with the USB interface via a standard PC serial emulation port
(TTY).\\
